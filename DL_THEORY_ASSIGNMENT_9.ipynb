    "1. **Mode Collapse**: The generator may converge to a limited set of modes, generating similar or identical samples rather than diverse ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vanishing Gradient**: Training can suffer from vanishing gradients, especially when the discriminator becomes too confident, making it difficult for the generator to learn.\n",

    "4. **Divergence**: The training process may diverge, where the generator produces unrealistic samples, and the discriminator fails to provide useful feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: GANs are sensitive to learning rates, architecture choices, and initialization, making finding the right settings challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Mode Dropping**: The generator may fail to cover all the modes in the data distribution, leaving some modes unrepresented in the generated samples.\n",

    "7. **Balance between Generator and Discriminator**: Achieving the right balance and convergence between the generator and discriminator is difficult and critical for effective training.\n",
